[b]Comment Anywhere  == The series of minahito's great works ==[/b]


[b]SUMMARY:[/b]
A module for appending quick-comment-form just after the body of contents.
If you want to change plain textarea to XOOPS dhtml form, use the plug-in for Smarty named "smarty_dhtml_v100"
You can find it in sourceforge.jp (http://sourceforge.jp/projects/exmodules)


[b]HOW TO INSTALL[/b]
First of all, you have to put exFrame >= 0.87 into your modules folder.
It is not necessary to install exFrame. Just put it.
If you already put exFrame there, skip this operation.

Turn "Hooking block" on to the modules you want by block admin.
Anywhere (left or right) , any weight is all right.
Add the permission to all (even guests) by group admin.

You can use "blocks admin module" for your convenience. :-)

You'd better set the weight of "Hooking block" large as possible.

After this, clear complied cache files in templates_c/.
You can find such a feature in admin of this module.


[b]NOTICE[/b]

[b]HOW TO UNINSTALL[/b]

1. Turn "Hooking block" off.
2. Clear the compiled cache.
